        <p> This is a word count webpage developed using python django v3.0.5 by me.
            I am new to python with some background of programming before.
            I am learning python for web development for now and this is a sample project which I began with.
            Later, I will be learning about the deep learning, Machine learning & AI and data science with python as
            well. Wish me luck :)
